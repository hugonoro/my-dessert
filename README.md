# My Dessert

Web site template for browsing and uploading dessert recipes and creating shopping lists based on the recipe ingredients. It's still on a very early stage and only implemented on the client side, mocking server side calls.

Future work goals:
  - Convert to Angular 2.0
  - Investigate the need to integrate Redux for managing states
  - Integrate Google Angular-Material (when v2.0 is released)
  - Integrate server side web api
  - Implement E2E testing with protractor
  - Implement new features
